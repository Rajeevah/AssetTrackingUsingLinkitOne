# AssetTrackingUsingLinkitOne

This project is based on link it one board which has onboard GPS, GSM and wifi. 

The project uses the GPS location and uploads to a broker(mosquitto in this case). Can be changed via the macro) via GPRS interface.

The macros inside the code is self explanatory(topic, broker name , port etc). Modify accordingly and deploy. Insert a sim card with a good data plan and track any asset where you deploy this by enclosing it in a Black Box.
